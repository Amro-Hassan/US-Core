Many of the profiles in this guide reference other FHIR resources that are also US Core profiles. This is defined in the formal profile definitions. For example, US Core CareTeam Profile references US Core Patient. For any other references to base FHIR resource1 or not formally defined in a US Core profiles, the referenced resource SHOULD be a US Core profile if a US Core profile exists for the resource type. For example, although Condition.asserter is not constrained by this guide, the reference to Patient or Practitioner SHOULD be a valid US Core Patient or US Core Practitioner.  US Core Resources in the differential view marked as Must-Support follow the Must Support rules listed above.  Other resources allowed in the base FHIR specification may be sent even though the current publication framework does not display them.  For example, RelatedPerson is an allowed target reference in `DocumentReference.author`.

There are scenarios when contained resources are used in US Core profiles. They occur when the content referred to in the contained resource does not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains it. For example, the Medication List Guidance page describes how a contained Medication in MedicationRequest is used for representing the medication. When referencing a contained resource in a US Core profile, the contained resource SHOULD be a US Core profile if a US Core profile exists for the resource type.
