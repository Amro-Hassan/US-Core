disagree with 41 would not add this use to procedure without implementer support.

discuss 43   Device can support at a minimum implantables and unclear of what
the detailed description would be before moving

47, 49, 52  intent was only to support narrative for Careplan and adding `goal`  or
`activity.detail.performer` or  `addresses` to CarePlan needs discussion or Highlight in
Block so implementers are aware.

115 Add Encounter Search by Identifier

120 disagree not per  the capabilility statement lists all the modifiers for all
the parameters.

121 changed "Will add status to search, and consider authoredOn" to "Will add
status to search (-use from US meds mandatory?) and authorOn (mandatory? + gt,lt)"

125   changed "Will add status to search, and consider authoredOn" to "Will add
status to search (-use from US meds mandatory?) and effective (mandatory? + gt,lt)"

123  disagree, "add in patientInstruction as must support"  - what is the justification
for all implementers to support. Thee are no other must supports as site, route etc.

129,131,146 search optional or mandatory?
