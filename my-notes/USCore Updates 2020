As Brett and I dug into the changes to make intent = "plan" for patient reported meds we found that trying to define a simple search for all meds is impossible because intent = "plan" is not limited to reported medications

updated section with inline edits.

A couple of options to consider for searching for all meds...

1) search in Three parts:

    1. provider part or parameters: patient = [id] , intent = 'order' same as is currently documented
    1. reported meds part A parameters: patient = [id] , intent = 'plan' and define a new searchparameter reportedBoolean = True
    1.  reported meds part B parameters: patient = [id] , intent = 'plan' define a new searchparameter and use the `missing` modifier to get reportedReference:missing = False

2) create a single custom query ( aka $get_all_meds ) and define additional parameters that can be used with it:  `status` = "active", `encounter` = "[id]"
