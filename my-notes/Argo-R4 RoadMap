Must Support
Courtesy of NPRM text:
Use Case specific

"More specifically, we
clarify that all data elements indicated as "mandatory" and "must support" by the proposed
standards and implementation specifications must be supported and would be in scope for
testing. Through this approach, certification will provide for a consistent and predictable starting
scope of data from which apps and other services can be developed."

Must Support and "must be supported"  are not the same

recommend that ONC change this word to "Have the capability to represent all the mandatory data elements.  Have the capability to represent all the must support data elements when the source data is available."
