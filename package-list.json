  "introduction": "The US Core Profiles were originally designed to meet the 2015 Edition certification criterion for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7), and Application Access – Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8). They were created for each item in the 2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS). The Location, Organization, and Practitioner Profiles are not called out specifically in the certification criteria but are included because they are directly referenced by other profiles. The US Core Profiles are informed by the prior Data Access Framework and the [Argonaut DSTU2](http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/) Implementation Guides. However, the profiles here are stand alone and include new requirements from the latest proposed ONC [U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/us-core-data-interoperability-uscdi) and includes all the [API Resource Collection in Health (ARCH)](https://www.healthit.gov/isa/api-resource-collection-health-arch) resources.  This implementation guide forms the foundation to build future US Realm FHIR implementation guides and its content will continue to grow to meet the needs of US implementers.",

Structured Documents and the [Argonaut Project Team](https://argonautwiki.hl7.org/Argonaut_2019_Projects#Argonaut_R4) have spent the last several months reviewing, testing and providing invaluable feedback on these and other topics including most notably:

      - A US Core Provenance Profile and Basic Provenance guidance on fetching Provenance for patient data.
      - Medication List Guidance for fetching a patient's medications
      - Recasting the US Core Device profile into a US Core Implantable Device Profile
      - A US Core spO2 by US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile
      - Updated search to support requiring search by multiple statuses
      - Guidance when the source has no data
      - General guidelines and considerations for DSTU2 to R4 Conversion
      - Guidance for language support
      - Considerations for fetching data for multiple patients]
      - Future considerations for times offset and timezone guidelines
      - Future Considerations for writing and updating data
      - Update security pageto reflect current testing.
      - Clarify definition of MustSupport to reflect the intent that the server must be able to populate a MustSupport element in order to claim conformance to the profile.
      - Expanding bindings for Procedure and Condition codes for quality measures and other purposes.

      These sections as well as several other clarifications, corrections and technical changes that are listed in the sections below have been reviewed and voted on by the members of the [HL7 International Structured Documents WorkGroup](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/structure/index.cfm) who is sponsoring this STU Update comment period and reconciliation of the comments.
