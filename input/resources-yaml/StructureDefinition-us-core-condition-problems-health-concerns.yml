description: The US Core Condition Problems and Health Concerns Profile is based upon
  the core FHIR Condition Resource and meets the  U.S. Core Data for Interoperability
  (USCDI) v2 'Problems' and 'Health Concerns' requirements and SDOH 'Problems/Health
  Concerns' requirements.  In version 5.0.0, The US Core Condition Profile has been
  split into the US Core Condition Encounter Diagnosis Profile and US Core Condition
  Problems and Health Concerns Profile.  To promote interoperability and adoption
  through common implementation, this profile defines constraints and extensions on
  the Condition resource for the minimal set of data to record, search, and fetch
  information about a condition, diagnosis, or other event, situation, issue, or clinical
  concept that is documented and categorized as a problem or health concern including
  information about a Social Determinants of Health-related condition. It identifies
  which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present
  in the resource when and constrains the way the elements are used using this profile.
  It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.
