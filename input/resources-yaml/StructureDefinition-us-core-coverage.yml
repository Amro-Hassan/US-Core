description: The US Core Coverage Profile is based upon the core FHIR Coverage Resource
  and implements the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v3 Health Insurance
  Information requirements. To promote interoperability and adoption through common
  implementation, this profile sets minimum expectations for the Coverage resource
  to record, search, and fetch the "data related to an individual's insurance coverage
  for health care". It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and
  value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this profile. It provides
  the floor for standards development for specific use cases.

    comment: The `Coverage.status` alone does not indicate whether an individual's
      coverage is terminated or that the individual is not covered. The `Coverage.period`
      needs to be considered as well.
