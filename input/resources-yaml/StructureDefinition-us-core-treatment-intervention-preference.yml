description: This profile represents personal health goals, preferences, and priorities
  for medical treatments or interventions in the event of a future health scenario
  where a person is unable to make medical decisions because of a serious illness
  or injury. To promote interoperability and adoption through common implementation,
  this profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation resource to record, search,
  and fetch for a patient's treatment intervention preferences. This profile identifies
  which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present
  in the resource and constrains the way the elements are used when using this profile.
  It provides the floor for standards development for specific use cases.

    definition: The time or time-period the observed value is asserted as being true.
      For biological subjects - e.g. human patients - this is usually called the "physiologically
      relevant time".
    comment: At least a date should be present unless this observation is a historical
      report.
