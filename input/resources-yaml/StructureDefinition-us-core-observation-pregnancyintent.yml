description: The US Core Pregnancy Intent Observation Profile is based upon the core
  FHIR Observation Resource and implements the US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)
  v3 Pregnancy status requirements. To promote interoperability and adoption through
  common implementation, this profile sets minimum expectations for the Observation
  resource to record, search, and fetch the "patient's intent to become pregnant"
  over the next year. It identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies,
  and value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource and constrains the way the elements
  are used when using this profile. It provides the floor for standards development
  for specific use cases.
