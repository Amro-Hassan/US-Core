description: The US Core Simple Observation Profile meets the requirements of the
  US Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Assessments. This profile promotes interoperability
  and adoption through common implementation by setting minimum expectations for the
  Observation resource to record, search, and retrieve observations representing a
  practitioner's clinical observation or assertion about a patient's health status.
  These observations may or may not be associated with a formal survey, screening,
  or assessment tool. For example, a social history status such as education or food
  insecurity or an assessment of the patient's cognitive, functional, or disability
  status. This profile identifies which core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and
  value sets **SHALL** be present in the resource when using this profile. It provides
  the floor for standards development for specific use cases.
