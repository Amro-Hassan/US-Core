description: This profile sets minimum expectations for the Immunization resource
  to record, search, and fetch immunization history associated with a patient to promote
  interoperability and adoption through common implementation.  It identifies which
  core elements, extensions, vocabularies, and value sets **SHALL** be present in
  the resource when using this profile.  It provides the floor for standards development
  for specific use cases.

    definition: Indicates whether the data contained in the resource was captured
      by the individual/organization which was responsible for the administration
      of the vaccine rather than as 'secondary reported' data  documented by a third
      party. A value of 'true' means this data originated with the individual/organization
      which was responsible for the administration of the vaccine.
    comment: This updated definition is adopted from the FHIR R5 Immunization resource.
