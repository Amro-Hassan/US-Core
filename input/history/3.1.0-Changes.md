<!-- ************ NOTE TO BALLOTERS ************-->


In order meet the proposed ONC [U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI)] regulatory requirements for access to patient data, this STU Update of the US Core Implementation Guide has added new content. Structured Documents and the [Argonaut Project Team](https://argonautwiki.hl7.org/Argonaut_2019_Projects#Argonaut_R4) have spent the last several months reviewing, testing and providing invaluable feedback on these and other topics including most notably:

- A [US Core Provenance Profile] and [Basic Provenance] guidance on fetching Provenance for patient data.
- [Medication List Guidance] for fetching a patient's medications
- Recasting the US Core Device profile into a [US Core Implantable Device Profile]
- A US Core spO2 by [US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile]
- Updated search to support [requiring search by multiple statuses](general-guidance.html#search-for-servers-requiring-status)
- Guidance when the source has [no data](general-guidance.html#missing-data)
- General guidelines and considerations for [DSTU2 to R4 Conversion](r2-r4-guidance.html)
- Guidance for [language support](general-guidance.html#language-support)
- Considerations for fetching data for [multiple patients](general-guidance.html#searching-multiple-patients)
- Future considerations for [times offset and timezone guidelines](future-of-us-core.html#candidates-under-consideration)
- Future Considerations for [writing and updating data](future-of-us-core.html#candidates-under-consideration)
- Update [security page](security.html) to reflect current testing.
- Clarify [definition of MustSupport](general-guidance.html#must-support) to reflect the intent that the server must be able to populate a MustSupport element in order to claim conformance to the profile.
- Expanding bindings for Procedure and Condition codes for quality measures and other purposes.

These sections as well as several other clarifications, corrections and technical changes that are listed in the sections below have been reviewed and voted on by the members of the [HL7 International Structured Documents WorkGroup](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/structure/index.cfm) who is sponsoring this STU Update comment period and reconciliation of the comments.
