**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for this profile:

-   Query for a specific clinical test result such as electrocardiogram (ECG)
-   Query for a specific imaging test result
-   Query for a specific Radiology note (e.g., 84178-3 Interventional Radiology Note)
-   Query for category of reports (e.g. all Cardiology reports)


### Mandatory and Must Support Data Elements

The following data-elements must always be present ([Mandatory] definition) or must be supported if the data is present in the sending system ([Must Support] definition). They are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation.  Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well.  The [Formal Views] below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.  

**Each Diagnostic Report must have:**

1.  a status
1.  a category
1.  a code describing the type of report
1.  a patient
1.  the diagnostically relevant time (known as the "effective time" and typically the time of the procedure)*

\*This element has the following constraint: **SHALL** be present if status is
'partial', 'preliminary', 'final', 'amended', 'corrected' or 'appended'.

**Each Diagnostic Report must support:**

1.  the encounter the report occurred within
1.  instant the report was released
1.  an author (actor) producing the report
2.  a reference to one or more test results
2.  a reference to one or more images
4.  a reference to the full report (presentedForm)

**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

- See [Clinical Notes]
- The `DiagnosticReport.category` binding must support at a minimum the [US Core DiagnosticReport Category Codes] of Cardiology, Radiology, and Pathology. Other categories may be supported.
  - <span class="bg-success" markdown="1">It is up to the data source to categorize the documents they send. Therefore, clients need to understand that data categorization is somewhat subjective and the categorization applied by the source may not align with the clientâ€™s expectations. Any linkages between specific LOINC codes and the LP-type codes may be used as guidance. If LOINC develops a hierarchy or categorization to align these concepts, US Core will be updated.</span><!-- new-content -->
- A server will return how a customer has categorized their reports at a particular site. Categorization of reports is not consistent across sites. (e.g. a system may categorize an orthopedic note as cardiology.)
- For Diagnostic Imaging Reports systems **SHOULD** support using the subset of  LOINC codes defined in CONF-DIR-19 in *HL7 Implementation Guide for CDA Release 2: Imaging Integration, Levels 1, 2, and 3, Basic Imaging Reports in CDA and DICOM Diagnostic Imaging Reports (DIR) - Universal Realm, Release 1.0.*
-  Diagnostic imaging results in visual images requiring interpretation and clinical test results/reports may also reference images as part of the report. The DiagnosticReport resource links to both [Media] which represents a specific kind of Observation whose value is image data and [ImagingStudy] which represents the content in a DICOM imaging study.
   * Only Media is marked as must support in this profile
   * The imagingStudy element **MAY** be used by systems to reference ImagingStudy.  However, it is not supported by the majority of systems and its inclusion would be an unnecessary barrier to adoption.
