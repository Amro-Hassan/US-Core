# ===========================================================-=====================

# === Added this STU NOTE: This profile is technically non-conformant with the base FHIR ver 4.0.1 vitals profile which defines a required binding that excludes the concept for L/min for Observation.component.value(x). This is a known issue and it means validation errors may occur when validating against this version of the US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile. A change request to relax the binding in the FHIR Vitals profile to has been made and approved in base FHIR ver 4.3.0 (“Release 4B”) which will correct this error when this guide is based a newer version of FHIR. ===

# === The following comment is understood and acknowledged.  In some cases it inherits binding from core and A change request to correct this has been applied to the base FHIR ver 4.3.0 (“Release 4B”) to clarify the binding applies to the Quantity data type. Will need to slice value[x] in future ===

The element Observation.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/us-core-vital-signs: StructureDefinition.differential.element[14].binding: The element Observation.component.value[x] has a binding, and has multiple types subject to bindings ([dateTime, boolean, string, SampledData, Quantity, Period, Ratio, integer, time, Range, CodeableConcept]). The binding will apply to all the types


# ==== The following content is inherited from the base standard and cannot be changed ====

The markdown contains content that appears to be an embedded HTML tag starting at 'Th'. This will (or SHOULD) be escaped by the presentation layer. The content should be checked to confirm that this is the desired behaviour
The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# ==== The pattern is set in a repeating slice.  The pattern is expected to hold for all repetitions of that slice.  (It's fixing the 'system' for the identifier.) ====

# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The type specified in ofType is Quantity *is* a possible candidate for the existing types of value[x]. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The type specified in ofType is CodeableConcept *is* a possible candidate for the existing types of value[x]. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===


# === This Search Parameter expression `[Type].subject.where(resolve() is Patient)` is inherited from the FHIR base.  Nevertheless, the maximum cardinality of `subject` is 1 for all of these cases so there will never be more than han one item in the collection when resolving the reference. Additionally, this invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written. ===


# === This Search Parameter expression `Goal.target.due as date` is inherited from the FHIR base.  This is a legitimate warning and in R5 the expression has been udpated to `(Goal.target.due.ofType(date))`.  Since US Core inherits from the FHIR R4 base this warning is acknowledged as an issue with the base specification. ===

WARNING: SearchParameter/us-core-goal-target-date: SearchParameter.expression: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'Goal.target.due as date' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The resolve() specified in the invariant has a maximum cardinality of 1 so there will never be more than han one item in the collection when resolving the reference. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written ===

# ==== The US Core Team is aware of this and will budget accordingly in a future publication cycle ===

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book)

# ==== Understood and note the this is rendered by the ig-publisher in the ig as well =====

The value set expansion is too large, and only a subset has been displayed
