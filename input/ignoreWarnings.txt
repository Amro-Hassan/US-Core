# === Added this STU NOTE: This profile is technically non-conformant with the base FHIR ver 4.0.1 vitals profile which defines a required binding that excludes the concept for L/min for Observation.component.value(x). This is a known issue in and it means validation errors may occur when validating against this version of the US Core Pulse Oximetry Profile. A change request to correct this has been applied to the base FHIR ver 4.3.0 (“Release 4B”)===

The string value contains text that looks like embedded HTML tags. If this content is rendered to HTML without appropriate post-processing, it may be a security risk

# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The type specified in ofType is Quantity *is* a possible candidate for the existing types of value[x]. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written


# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The type specified in ofType is CodeableConcept *is* a possible candidate for the existing types of value[x]. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written


# === This Search Parameter expression `[Type].subject.where(resolve() is Patient)` is inherited from the FHIR base.  Nevertheless, the maximum cardinality of `subject` is 1 for all of these cases so there will never be more than han one item in the collection when resolving the reference. Additionally, this invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written.


# === This Search Parameter expression `Goal.target.due as date` is inherited from the FHIR base.  This is a legitimate warning and in R5 the expression has been udpated to `(Goal.target.due.ofType(date))`.  Since US Core inherits from the FHIR R4 base this warning is acknowledged as an issue with the base specification.

WARNING: SearchParameter/us-core-goal-target-date: SearchParameter.expression: The left side is inherently a collection, and so the expression 'Goal.target.due as date' may fail or return false if there is more than one item in the content being evaluated

# ===  The following Warning is understood and the invariant reviewed. The resolve() specified in the invariant has a maximum cardinality of 1 so there will never be more than han one item in the collection when resolving the reference. This invariant has been tested in the FHIRPath tester and is intended as written
