The US Core Profiles were originally designed to meet the 2015 Edition certification criterion for Patient Selection 170.315(g)(7) and Application Access â€“ Data Category Request 170.315(g)(8). They were created for each item in the [2015 Edition Common Clinical Data Set (CCDS)]. The Location, Organization, and Practitioner Profiles are not called out specifically in the certification criteria but are included because other profiles directly reference them. The US Core Profiles are informed by the prior [Data Access Framework] and the [Argonaut Data Query] Implementation Guides. However, the profiles here are stand-alone and include requirements from the [U.S. Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) v4].

The table below lists the US Core Profile and FHIR Resources used for the corresponding USCDI Data elements. This information is also available as a [csv](uscdi-table.csv) or [excel](uscdi-table.xlsx) file:
