
This page lists all the ValueSets, CodeSystems, and ConceptMaps defined as part of the US Core implementation Guide. For more information on using codes in US Core, see the [FHIR Terminology] section in the FHIR specification and the [Coded Elements] section in this guide.

### Value Sets

These value sets have been defined for this implementation guide.

<!-- ================================================ -->
<!--  use this line to include an autogenerated list of all profiles and highlight new ones using the input/data/new_stuff.yml list.  Remove it if you would like to hand generate it -->

{% include res-list-generator.md type="ValueSet" %}

<!-- ================================================ -->

### Code Systems

See the [FHIR terminology section]({{site.data.fhir.path}}terminologies-systems.html) for a complete discussion on code systems and a list of codes system names used in FHIR.  Most code systems used in this guide are defined in the base FHIR specification. The following code systems are unique to this guide and not listed in the base FHIR specification.  If a URI is listed here, it **SHALL** be used in the US Core profiles to identify the code system in preference to any other code system URI.


**Code systems published in this IG** - Includes US Core defined code systems and externally defined code systems

### Using Value Set Authority Center (VSAC)

This guide links terminology directly to the FHIR® Terminology Service for VSAC Resources ([Value Set Authority Center (VSAC) - NIH](https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/)) where applicable using a RESTful API service for accessing the VSAC value sets and supported code systems.

  - It is a requirement of VSAC to log in using your own *UMLS API Key* to view the value sets. [VSAC UMLS Licensing information](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/usingvsac/requestumlslicense.html).  (See the screen shots below)
  - The value sets in VSAC are specified using a VSAC value set OID.  
  - To view the value set expansion in the VSAC user interface, use:

      `GET https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/ValueSet/[VSAC OID]/expansion`

    An example of this is shown in the screenshots below.  

  - To fetch the FHIR ValueSet resource (in other words, the value set definition) use:

       `GET https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/[VSAC OID]`

  - To fetch the FHIR ValueSet resource expansion use the FHIR `$expand` operation:

       `GET https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/[VSAC OID]/$expand`

For more information refer to the [FHIR Terminology Service for VSAC Resources](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/vsac/support/usingvsac/vsacfhirapi.html)


For example, the [US Core Smoking Status Observation Profile] valueCodeableConcept element has a preferred binding to the Smoking Status value set. To access it in VSAC, click on the link to `https://vsac.nlm.nih.gov/valueset/2.16.840.1.113883.11.20.9.38/expansion`:

 {% include img.html img="vsac-1.png" caption="Figure 1: VSAC link" %}

The reader is redirected to the VSAC login page to enter an API Key (only one login is required per session):

 {% include img.html img="vsac-2.png" caption="Figure 2: VSAC API-Key Login" %}

After successfully entered the API Key the value set can be inspected, downloaded, etc. using the VSAC User interface as shown in the figure below.  This FHIR ValueSet resource can also be fetched using the url `https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.11.20.9.38`, and the FHIR ValueSet expansion using the url `https://cts.nlm.nih.gov/fhir/ValueSet/2.16.840.1.113883.11.20.9.38/$expand`.
