Procedure/defib-implant: Procedure.code	error	None of the codes provided are in the maximum value set http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-procedure-code (http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/ValueSet/us-core-procedure-code, and a code from this value set is required) (codes = http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt#33249) (see Tx log)

Cause: Due to no expansion of ValueSet since uses CPT codes ( IP issues )

Resolution: Unknown since IP issues is intractable

3) CarePlan/colonoscopy: CarePlan.category	error	Unable to resolve discriminator
CarePlan/colonoscopy: CarePlan	information	Profile http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core/StructureDefinition/us-core-careplan, Element 'CarePlan.category[assessplan]'': Unable to check minimum required (1) due to lack of slicing validation

Is the slice definition wrong (StructureDefinition-us-core-careplan.html)  or is it a tool issue with the pattern as discriminator?
