This profile sets minimum expectations for searching and fetching fetching patient documents including Clinical Notes using the [DocumentReference] resource. It is built upon the [US Core DocumentReference] profile. It identifies the mandatory core elements, extensions, vocabularies and value sets which **SHALL** be present in the DocumentReference resource when using this profile.

**Example Usage Scenarios:**

The following are example usage scenarios for the Argonaut Clinical Notes profile:

-   Query for all documents belonging to a Patient
-   Query for a specific Clinical Note type (e.g. Discharge Summary or Continuity of Care Document (CCD))
-   Query for all Clinical Notes belonging to a Patient
-   Write a new Note to a Patient's Chart

###### Mandatory Data Elements and Terminology

The following data-elements are mandatory (i.e data MUST be present). These are presented below in a simple human-readable explanation. Profile specific guidance and examples are provided as well. The [**Formal Profile Definition**](#profile) below provides the  formal summary, definitions, and  terminology requirements.  

**Each Clinical Note DocumentReference must have:**

1.  a category of the DocumentReference, referred to as class
1.  an author
1.  a patient
1.  a code describing the type of document
1.  a status
1.  date and time the reference was created (STU3 requirement, removed in R4)
1.  an https address where the document can be retrieved

In addition it should have (if available):

1.  the organization responsible for the document, referred to as custodian.
1.  a business identifier for the DocumentReference (possibly generated by the transcription system or EHR)
1.  a document creation date
1.  a code identifying the specific details about the format of the document â€” over and above the content's MIME type
1.  the patient encounter date that is being referenced


**Profile specific implementation guidance:**

- The `DocumentReference.type` binding must support at a minimum the [5 Common Clinical Notes] and may extend to the full  [HITSP C80 Table 2-144 Document Class Value Set Definition]
- For a C-CDA Clinical Summary of Care (CCD):
   -  The document type code is the LOINC code [34133-9] *Summary of episode note*.
   -  The format code is `urn:hl7-org:sdwg:ccda-structuredBody:2.1`
-   The `content.url` may refer to a FHIR Binary Resource (i.e. [base]/Binary/[id]), FHIR Document Bundle (i.e [base]/Bundle/[id] or other endpoint.

###### Examples

-  [DocumentReference-episode-summary] Retrieve a URL for an episode summary note (CCD).
